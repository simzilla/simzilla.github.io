      <h2><a href="/plan-of-attack.html">What Lies before Us??</a></h2>
      <h3>Wed 06 July 2016</h3>
      
  <p>I believe it is unwise to approach a problem without a plan of attack.  In this case my first problem is developing a plan of attack so I obviously need a plan to attack the development of my plan.</p>
<p>I see this thing going pretty sequentially.  For instance, I am mostly writing this second post so that I can make sure I have the basics of this Pelican thing under control.  Its not brain surgery by any means but I like making sure my platform is sound.  This brings me to step 1</p>
<h2>This ratty Pelican Blog</h2>
<p>I chose Pelican because I know my way around Python and Pelican seems super easy to use and host if I decide to do that. My first in depth post will be writing about how I got this blog up and running.</p>
<p>After that I think I am going to change this theme up.  I can't decide if I hate or just don't like it but it definitely needs some tweaks.  That should be a fairly quick project...we shall see.</p>
<h2>WordPress</h2>
<p>Once I am comfortable here, I intend to dive into WordPress.  I think its pretty nuts what people charge to do really simple things in WordPress.  I want to get into some full blown customization.  I am not certain that I have the designers eye for it...I think thats whats really holding me back but I think I can at least get comfortable.</p>
<h2>Stops along the Way</h2>
<p>I haven't truly taken the time to teach myself CSS and GIT.  Those seem like the two most major deficiencies Im facing.  CSS I'm fairly familiar with, but I don't know all of the finer points and I think thats important.  GIT always gives me trouble but thats because I haven't been forced to use it.  I've messed around but I think it is an important tool that I need to get intimate with.  Ill probably tackle this first before I do anything else.</p>
<h2>Life is getting in the WAY!!!</h2>
<p>I kind of have a lot of school-ish things going on right now.  Testing for some certs and a few garbage courses.  I'm hoping that the threat factor dissipates and I can start focusing on this fun stuff soon.  My next post will either be about setting up this blog or getting intimate with GIT.  WE SHALL SEE!!!   </p>
