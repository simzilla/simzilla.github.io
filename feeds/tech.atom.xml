I've created it for several reasons.  First and foremost, I have made the decision to jump into several types of web development.  My current means of enployment does not faciliate any flexing of my artistic muscle.  I like producing things and web development seems like a way to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Build this Incredible Empire ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog, created utilizing Pelican, is my first forray into the wild web.  My second will be some WordPress development and after that hopefully a little web application creation.  I intend to chronicle that venture here.  Hopefully I can record my process and possibly help others in their venture or leave something that will assist aliens in learning about out culture.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I like writing and I need a place that I can put words on paper without damaging my future political career.  I don't intend on distrubuting this really widely or editing it very well.  Hopefully anyone that reads it will find me mildly literate.  &lt;/p&gt;
