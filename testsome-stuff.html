            <p>I wrote about this in my first post, but you'll never get to read it because I accidentally erased it all.  Anyway, my goal is to explore some web development.  I have alot of experience with academic computer stuff and networking theory but I don't get to play around very much or create anything.  The end state here is the creation of a sweet site for my wife's business, but along the way I have a few things I would like to try. </p>
<p>What I don't want to do is throw together a typical looking Wordpress blog.  I'd really like to learn about the backend stuff and explore some possibilities. </p>
<h3>Pelican Thoughts</h3>
<p>I've messed around with this Pelican blog some over the course of the last two weeks or so and I feel like I have a good grasp on it.  There  are several things I have noticed however:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is very little in the way of online community for Pelican support.</li>
<li>What little support exists is kind of outdated.</li>
<li>Web services are outside of my wheel house...feels like there are tons of choices.</li>
</ol>
<p>I personally think that a static website, Pelican being one of the several flavors of static site generators, is an awesome solution for alot of the blogs I come across and read.  A static website doesn't query a database and attempt to re-render a page every time it is accessed, instead the pages are generated on my computer and then I load some static data onto a server and you access it as html and supporting data from that server.  Its really fast getting to you and low cost for me to stash somewhere.  I could probably host this page from a server (10 year old laptop) at my house but Github pages is really nice and FREE too.  </p>
<p>This theme (bricks) is one of the themes in a repository on Github.  My next project will be the creation of a custom theme for this blog. I don't really have any strong commitment or plans for this blog.  I might change the name or drastically change the theme.  In the end, I hope that I can capture all of the steps I took to learn and develop it.    </p>
<h3>Next Post</h3>
<p>My next post is going to describe how I got this thing up and running.  I'm going to try and make it really simple for you...the zero people reading this blog...to get a Pelican blog out on the net so that you can air out your uniformed political views, bad recipes, workout regiment, or whatever.  I'm going to try and keep everything really simple.  I personally like knowing about the backend of everything I mess with but right now I'm not sure if I want to get into that on this blog or keep everything really simple.  We'll see.</p>
<p>Until then think about this, how many years do you think it will be till someone is charged with negligent homicide because they chose to drive their car instead of letting it be driven autonomously.   </p>
